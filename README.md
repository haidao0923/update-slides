# update-slides
The goal of this project is to automate the boring manual task of creating a new graphic every week for Board Game Club meetings. Before, I had to click and type several times to change the date and location of the weekly meeting as well as clicking to save the file to a specific location. This simplify the process, and I just have to input the date and location one time when running the script. In addition, simply changing a few parameters, I could update multiple graphics very quickly.

As the club grows in size, I needed to generate the images for multiple meetings in a single week and combine them into a single image to post on our Discord server. As such, I use the Pillow library in Python to accomplish this task.

<i>This script save approximately 30 minutes per week to generate 5 different images for weekly announcements and meetings</i>
